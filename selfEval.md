# Self Evaluation

### Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
I think it's crucial to look ahead at the assignments and upcoming classes in order to gauge where I am at and how I might divide my remaining time. If I have a class tomorrow, an assignment and reflection due for that class, it helps to measure how much time I might think I need for the assignment (plus 15%) in order to guess what my time might look like.

### How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
"Ok Timmy, think of the microwave you use to warm up your food as a function. It does one thing - heats up food. But it does this with any kind of food you want. Do you want to re-heat your leftovers? Then hit the 'leftovers' button. Or when you are watching you favorite movie and need some popcorn, that is what the 'popcorn' button is for. In this same way, a microwave can take any feasible food to be warmed up (the parameter(s)) and when you use it (call the function) and tell it what to warm up (pass an agrument) it will do just that and only that."

### Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
A parameter is sort of like a label that goes with the function when it is declared. This signals to any developer what kind of arguments should be passed to the function so that the program does not run into any future trouble. For example, if it wasn't clear that the data type passed as an argument to a function is supposed to be a string, and a number is passed instead.
Then an argument, as we can sumise, is the actual data being given to the function to be manipulated.

### What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to bring to your Small Group?
Nothing that I can think of at this time.
